:::note

Other short-lived CAs, such as those used to [secure SSH servers behind Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/short-lived-certificates-legacy/), are incompatible with the Gateway SSH proxy. For SSH logging to work, you must create a new CA using the `gateway_ca` API endpoint.
:::

1. Make a `POST` request to the Cloudflare API with your email address and [API key](/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/) as request headers.

   ```bash
   curl --request POST \
   "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/access/gateway_ca" \
   --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
   --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
   ```

2. Copy the `public_key` value returned in the response.
